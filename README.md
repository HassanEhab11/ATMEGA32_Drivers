Hello, my name is Hassan Ehab, and I'm passionate about embedded systems. This repository includes a part of my journey in learning about embedded systems.
My hope is that this repository will be helpful for others who are also embarking on a similar journey.

The repository contains projects, code samples, and other resources related to embedded systems that I've collected and developed over time. 
These resources cover a range of topics, including microcontrollers, sensors, communication protocols, and more.

I've always been fascinated by the potential of embedded systems to solve real-world problems, and I'm constantly learning and exploring new ideas in this field. 
I hope that my experiences and the resources in this repository will inspire others to join me on this journey.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my repository, and I hope that you find it useful. 
If you have any questions or would like to discuss embedded systems further, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. ðŸ™‚
